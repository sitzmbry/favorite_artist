     <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabaton_(band)">Sabaton was formed in December 1999.</a> After the first songs were recorded in Peter Tägtgren's studio, The Abyss, Sabaton was contacted by a couple of record labels. The band signed with the Italian label Underground Symphony, under which internationally released the promo CD Fist for Fight, a compilation consisting of material from two demo tapes recorded between 1999 and 2000, with the intention to promote forthcoming releases. In 2002, a new album was recorded. Metalizer was supposed to be distributed by Underground Symphony as the band's debut album, but after two years of waiting, during which the band held various performances across Sweden, the album was abandoned.</p><br>
